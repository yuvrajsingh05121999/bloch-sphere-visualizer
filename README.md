# 🔮 Bloch Sphere Visualizer

A Streamlit-based interactive tool for visualizing single-qubit quantum states on the Bloch sphere. Built using Qiskit, this app allows you to prepare custom states, apply quantum gates, and explore how they affect the qubit’s state vector.

## 🚀 Features

- Visualize pure states and density matrices on the Bloch sphere.
- Support for standard gates (X, Y, Z, H, S, T, S†, T†, RX, RY, RZ).
- Create and apply custom unitary gates.
- Two operation modes:
  - **Single-Gate Mode**: Instantly see the effect of any one gate.
  - **Gate Sequence Mode**: Build and simulate a series of gates step-by-step.
- View and compare initial and final quantum state data.
